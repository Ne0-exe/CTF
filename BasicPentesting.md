# CTF: Basic Pentesting
 *Date: 18 Jan 2024*

## Task description
In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:

- brute forcing 
- hash cracking 
- service enumeration
- Linux Enumeration

The main goal here is to learn as much as possible.

## Walkthrough

Basic pentesting should be, well... basic. What do we do in such situation at first place? 
If the only rescource we were given was IP address, the most reasonable activity should be network scanning. 
Why do we do that? Scanning allows us to extend our visibility onto what our target basically is, and it's not only a mysterious set of numbers.
Thanks to network scanning we can get information on which ports are here, if they're opened/closed and much, much more.
If it's basic pentesting and I'm basic pentester (yes, I'm testing pens, how did you know that?), we shoudl use... YES, that's right,
basic tools. Which network scanning tool is the most popular and basic? Nmap. Have I just called Nmap basic? Uhm, yes, but I didn't mean that.
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. In previous sentence I've just
denied that Nmap should be considered basic. It's not just a network scanner, because it can do much more but in that CTF we won't be using 
it's full potential.

Let's go straight to the command line.

`$ nmap -A -vv -oN nmap_scan 10.10.180.109`

Let me explain those flags:
- `-A` - enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute (let's say it's the sum of `-sV` and `-O`
- `-vv` - what can I say, I like talkative tools, this flag means very verbose so it's just flooding me with more or less relevant info
- `-oN` - print to normal output but I recommend using `-oS` for formal reports*

_*sike, check the docs before blind follow_

Here comes the cropped output because `-vv` flag might not provide meat only but also potatos and salad.
