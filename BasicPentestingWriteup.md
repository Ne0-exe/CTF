1. Find the services exposed by the machine

	Check NMAP.md for full scan info


2. What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)? 
	
	gobuster -> development


 3. User brute-forcing to find the username & password 

 	So at port 139 we have Samba, then using enum4linux I can gather 2 usernames: kay & jan

 	More info in enum4linux.log file


 4.  What is the password? 


 	Simply using hydra on ssh service (port 22) to find out jan's password -> armando


5.  What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)? 
	

	I'm using ssh service.


6. No answer needed.


9. Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation.

	In kay's directory I've found id_rsa which helped me getting into kay's account..well I thought it would help. Service wanted passphrase for key so I had to include John The Ripper (ssh2john and then john to be more specific).

8. What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)? 
	
	Well, it must be kay. Thanks to john I've encoded id_rsa key (passphrase: beeswax) and could get into kay's account.



9.	If you have found another user, what can you do with this information? 


Thanks to john I've found and encoded id_rsa key (passphrase: beeswax) which is located in kay/.ssh/ and could get into kay's account.

10.  What is the final password you obtain? 

	In pass.bak file -> heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
