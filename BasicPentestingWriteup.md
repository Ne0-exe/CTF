1.Find the services exposed by the machine
	
	22/tcp   open  ssh         syn-ack OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
	80/tcp   open  http        syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
	139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn syn-ack Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
	445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn syn-ack Samba smbd 4.3.11-Ubuntu (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
	8009/tcp open  ajp13?      syn-ack
	8080/tcp open  http-proxy  syn-ack

2.What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)? 
	
	gobuster -> development

3.User brute-forcing to find the username & password 

 	So at port 139 we have Samba, then using enum4linux I can gather 2 usernames: kay & jan

4.What is the password? 

 	Simply using hydra on ssh service (port 22) to find out jan's password -> armando

5.What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)? 
	
	I'm using ssh service.

6.No answer needed.
9.Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation.

	In kay's directory I've found id_rsa which helped me getting into kay's account..well I thought it would help. Service wanted passphrase for key so I had to include John The Ripper (ssh2john and then john to be more specific).

8.What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)? 
	
	Well, it must be kay. Thanks to john I've encoded id_rsa key (passphrase: beeswax) and could get into kay's account.

9.If you have found another user, what can you do with this information? 

	Thanks to john I've found and encoded id_rsa key (passphrase: beeswax) which is located in kay/.ssh/ and could get into kay's account.

10.What is the final password you obtain? 

	In pass.bak file -> heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
